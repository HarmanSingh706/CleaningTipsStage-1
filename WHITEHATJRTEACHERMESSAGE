I understand that GetTips screen is not working currently and will fix that next stage, sorry for the inconvience.

User Actions:
1. User will add tips and will set a contact email.
2. User can email the person who created the app directly and ask for an announcement for people to put a tip for a specific problem they are having.
3. User can give thumbs ups to the tip to show that the tip works.
