I understand that GetTips screen is not working currently and will fix that next stage, sorry for the inconvience.

User Actions (In The Code Currently More To Come In More Stages.):
1. User will add tips and will set a contact email.
2. User can email the person who created the app directly and ask for an announcement for people to put a tip for a specific problem they are having.
